    "This is the Jupyter notebook of MMLO's week 5. In Exercise 1, you are given an LP problem and you are asked to find its dual problem and solve both problems with the graphical interpretation of the simplex method. In Exercise 2, a variation of the example seen in class (Boats4You) is introduced and you are asked some questions concerning duality. Finally, in Exercise 3, you are asked to find the dual problem of the given linear programming (LP) problems, and to idenitfy which of the cases of the duality theorem of linear programming applies.\n",
